# Social app

This is a social media web app that I am working on to develop my full-stack skills.

## How to use

### From web

TODO

### From source

1. Clone the repository using `git clone git@github.com:TeenageMutantCoder/sw-social-app.git` or `git clone https://github.com/TeenageMutantCoder/sw-social-app`
2. Change to the repository directory using `cd sw-social-app`
3. Make a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env` using `cp .env.example .env` (if using a Unix-based system) or `copy .env.example .env` (if using Windows)
4. Run the development server using `npm run dev`

## Tech stack

This project was bootstrapped using [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/). That means that the main technologies used are:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [TRPC](https://trpc.io/)
- [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/)

## MVP

Here are the features that I will definitely add:

- [ ] User auth
- [ ] Post (text) creation, editing, and deletion
- [ ] Likes on posts
- [ ] Comments (text) on posts (creation, editing, deleting)

## Future Improvements

Here are other things that I may add in the future:

- [ ] Algorithm for displaying new content
- [ ] More sophisticated user auth
- [ ] Friends list
- [ ] Direct private messaging
- [ ] Increased profile customization
- [ ] Search for posts/comments/users
- [ ] Save a user's favorited posts/comments
- [ ] Block users
- [ ] Multimedia posts
- [ ] Multimedia comments
- etc.
